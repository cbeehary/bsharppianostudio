                  <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Philosophy of Teaching</h3>
                    <p class="large text-muted">I've been teaching piano lessons for 8+ years. When teaching piano, I believe there is more to teach than just how to read the music. The ears must be trained to listen for beautiful tone. Technique must be mastered to produce the various subtleties of sound. Knowledge of the music's context leads to greater appreciation and interpretation. Understanding how the music is built unlocks the door to composing, improvising, and easier sight-reading. The resulting student is a strong pianist who is confident in a variety of settings: solo and ensemble performance, improvisation, accompanying, and composing.</p>
                  <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Biography</h3>
                    <p class="large text-muted">I started learning the piano in first grade when my Mom decided to buy a used piano with the money she had been saving up to buy a new living room sofa. She helped me get started, working through one of her old piano primers. I soon moved on to a few different teachers, finally finding Kelley Georgiafandis, who taught me from third grade until I graduated high school. She taught more than just playing notes on a page - I learned how to produce beautiful music. She developed an appreciation in me for understanding the music that I was playing - how it was built and how it fit into history (whether long ago or more recent). She was a wonderful teacher who demonstrated the importance of employing different teaching strategies to help students with various learning strengths.</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">In high school, I started improvising, arranging, and composing music. During those four years, I participated as a soloist in the Ohio Music Education Association's Solo and Ensemble Contests, accompanied my friends on their various instruments at this contest, and played Sunday mornings for my church. I also started teaching piano lessons to younger kids. I knew I loved to teach piano from the beginning.</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">I attended Case Western Reserve Univeristy where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science. However, I spent much of my time there pursuing musical growth. I completed Cleveland Institute of Music (CIM) Theory II, and I took piano lessons under Sean Schulze. I played the cello in the Case Orchestra, and we performed at Severance Hall. After all my music classes and activities, I earned a Minor in Music.</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">In addition to teaching piano lessons, I enjoy playing the piano/keyboard for my church. I love exploring the outdoors and working in my garden with my husband and two small children.</p>

                            <!-- <p class="item-intro text-muted">Individual Piano Instruction</p>-->
                            <!--<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/golden-preview.png" alt="">-->
                            <p>A few basic facts to help you get started:</p>
                            <ul class="text-left">
                                <li><strong>This piano program is semester based.</strong> This means that I ask for a commitment of one complete semester at a time. For more details, please check out the FAQs.</li>
                                <li><strong>The semester cost is $235, not including books and materials.</strong> Most people choose to make monthly payments: the first payment of the Fall Semester is larger so that it acts like a registration fee, and then the rest of tuition is split evenly between the rest of the months of the semester. There are usually 15 weeks to a semester, although it can vary by a week due to how holidays land on the calendar. Book cost per year for beginners is on average $20-$30.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lessons are weekly</strong> (except for holiday weeks, such as Thanksgiving and Spring Break). Beginning students' lessons last approximately 30-35 minutes (I schedule 35 minutes so I have a buffer).</li>
                                <li><strong>Practice at home should take place every day.</strong> First and second year beginners should practice 10-20 minutes each day. If your child finds it hard to sit still that long, you can break it up into two 10 minute sessions. As a student progresses, practice time will gradually increase.</li>
                                <li><strong>My teaching philosophy</strong> is that a piano student should become a well-rounded musician, learning not just how to read the notes but also learn music theory, proper technique, music history, and composition. Of course, everything is tailored to the student's level and taken step by step, with lots of reviewing along the way.</li>
                                <li><strong>For students younger than 3rd grade, a parent is required to attend each lesson.</strong> A parent should learn right alongside their child for awhile. Your student will get the most out of lessons if you can help guide them at home. I don't ask parents to become virtuosos by any means, but it does help the youngest students if you can at least help them structure practice time at home. I always encourage parents to reach out by email or phone during the week if they have questions about what should be practiced or how to play something - that way you don't have to wait until the next lesson to ask and we don't lose a week of progress!</li>

                            <p>Individual lessons for preschool and kindergarten students are 15-30 minutes long, depending on the attention span of the student. The semester cost is $180.</p>
                            
                            <p>At this age, fun is essential to any learning endeavor. Using games and plenty of good humor, our goals are to introduce the child to the basic concepts of the piano and music:</p>
                            
                            <ul class="text-left">
                                <li>Low, Middle, & High sounds, and where to find them on the piano</li>
                                <li>The Music Alphabet, and naming the piano keys</li>
                                <li>Good piano posture</li>
                                <li>Listening, listening, and more listening!</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>I am not a certified Suzuki teacher and this is not a Suzuki program. However, I do use some of the Suzuki concepts that encourage good tone production and the development of listening skills. Since attention span and fine muscle control vary so greatly from child to child at this age, the personality and maturity of the child will determine the pace.</p>
                            <p>Parents are required to attend lessons. To get the most out of these lessons, the parent should expect to be "the teacher at home" during daily 10-15 minute practice sessions.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Preschool through 2nd Grade</p>
                            <!--<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/startup-framework-preview.png" alt="">-->
                            <p>For Preschool through 2nd grade students, your involvement as a parent is critical. I ask that you attend and observe every lesson, in order for you to be able to guide your child at home during practice times. You will be learning a lot about music and the piano right along with your child, even if you don't have any musical training yourself. I will provide everything you need to help your child.</p>
                            <p>Your encouragement during home practice times is essential - it will take a lot of hard work on the student’s part for her small fingers to learn to obey what her brain is telling them to do. It will require a lot of patience and wisdom (and sometimes trial and error) from you, as you encourage every small accomplishment, learn when to push your child to try again at something hard, and learn when to back off and relax and just give some things time to develop and not stress her or yourself. I will be there to help you navigate this journey, to help you set expectations and brainstorm new ideas to help your child when she gets stuck.</p>
                            <p>At the beginning of the semester, you will need to sit with your child throughout almost every practice time at home. Every student should practice 20 minutes every day - if you find you have to practice more than this to accomplish the lesson assignment, then please talk to me and we will figure out what we can do. Towards the halfway point of the semester, your child will be able to do some parts of her assignment on her own as you listen from the next room.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">3rd Grade & Older</p>
                            <!--<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/startup-framework-preview.png" alt="">-->
                            <p>For 3rd grade and beyond, parents are not required to attend every lesson. However, parents should plan to attend lessons for elementary and middle school children at least once a month to be aware of what we are working on. Parents can also help their child by double-checking at home that the child is working on everything in the lesson assignment.</p>
                            <p>Regardless of age, encouragement from parents is crucial to every piano student. Please always tell your child whenever you hear a song you like.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>Do you require us to have a piano at home to practice on?</strong></p>
                            <p>No, but I strongly recommend getting a piano. Even with the weighted keys that many keyboards now have, pianos and keyboards are still two different instruments. If you want your child to learn to play a keyboard instrument, then get a keyboard. If you want your child to learn to play the piano, you need a piano. I will teach regardless of the instrument you choose. You can find many compact pianos being sold very cheaply on Craigslist, sometimes even free if you are willing to move it. Shop around until you find one you like. You should be able to find a decent starter piano (used) for between $200-$800.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>What age do you recommend as a starting age for piano lessons?</strong></p>
                            <p>I recommend starting piano lessons as a child enters 1st grade. Starting earlier than this presents a unique set of challenges because of the limited attention span and immature muscle control and strength at ages younger than 6 years old. It can be done, but it requires a much bigger commitment from the parent, who will essentially be the “piano teacher” at home during daily practice sessions.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>Do you teach music theory, composition, ear training, etc.?</strong></p>
                            <p>Throughout the year, we will cover a variety of topics. These topics include music theory, music history, composition, ear training, and more. The focus of the beginning of the Fall Semester is on music theory. Towards the end of the Fall Semester, we have fun learning Holiday music. In the Winter/Spring Semester, we have monthly themes of music history, February Fun month, ear training, and composition. At the end of the Winter/Spring Semester, we review everything we learned that year.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>How does your registration/payment work? Do you schedule week-to-week, yearly, etc.?</strong></p>
                            <p>My piano program is organized into two semesters: the Fall Semester, which runs from Labor Day through December (~15 weeks); and the Winter/Spring Semester, which runs January through April (~15 weeks). I require every student to register and commit to one semester at a time.</p>
                            <p>Summer lessons are available, but not mandatory. What this means is that if you choose not to take lessons during the summer, your spot will be reserved for you for the Fall Semester. Most of my students continue to take lessons through the summer every other week, the goal being to keep everyone from forgetting their skills over the summer! It is at a more laid back pace, and we pick more fun songs than usual.<p>
                            <p>I provide a few payment options, including 1 payment and monthly payments. More details are given at time of registration.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>Can a student start mid-semester?</strong></p>
                            <p>I do allow new students to start mid-semester at a prorated tuition cost, given there is room in my schedule.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>Are there any student recitals?</strong></p>
                            <p>Students are strongly encouraged to take part in one recital each semester: the Holiday Recital at the end of the Fall Semester, and the Spring Recital near the end of the Winter/Spring Semester.</p>
                            <p class="item-intro"><strong>Do you require recital pieces to be memorized?</strong></p>
                            <p>No, I do not require memorization of recital pieces, though some students do choose to memorize their recital pieces. Memorization of favorite pieces is something I strongly encourage, and we talk about it throughout the year. Students have different natural abilities to memorize (I knew one brilliant student who could not memorize any song no matter how hard she tried), so I do not have any given requirement for memorizing pieces.</p>
